One Hundred Year Study


Introduction
Brief description of the story. Cover three points which I am going to describe.

Health is one of the most vital factors in a living creature and represents
the level of a complex system, e.g., the ability to think, communicate, and support
other tasks of self-managing. In a modern society there are different institutions,
which provide options to support  mental and physical health of human beings.
However, given prices for urgent health-service or the fact, that sometimes you
have to wait for 3 days to get antibiotics for a pink-eye, make the opportunity
to have a personal doctor in your home or better pocket is desirable. Having a
mobile appllication, which is capable to detect whether person has a fever, because
he/she gets cold and recommends a suitable treatment saves money and time of the
patient and can contribute to doctors' time by decreasing the load. Nevertheless,
factors like cyberchondria and influence of pharmaceutical companies on developing
of such app to recommend "right" drugs, can be key in creating a mobile assistant.

Cyberchondria is a raise of health anxiety based on knwloadge about common symptomps
in rare and fatal diseases and is considered as a growing concern among
health-care institutions. As any other AI a possible mobile health-care assistant
requires to have data to work with. Since number of diseases have same symptoms,
to decrease the range of possible ilnesses, the manager might ask human about some
symptoms, which can influence on person opinion and his/her own perception. That
can leads to a wrong diagnose.

Insurance companies might be involved in developinig of such AI, and made people
to buy specific drugs. It is harder for doctor to lie.
