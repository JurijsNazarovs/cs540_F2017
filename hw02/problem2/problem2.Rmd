#(a) Number of tiles in $(m, n, k)$ - puzzle
The number of tiles is $mn - k$

#(b) Distinct states in the state space
First, we chose $k$ spaces from $mn$ possible places. Then, we have permutration of mn-k states to be counted as distinct states.

Thus, the answer is ${mn \choose k} (mn-k)!$

#(c) Graph of state space of a (2, 2, 1)-puzzle
There are 2 group of states: 1 - we can achieve the goal state, 2 - cannot achieve the goal state. Graph is below (2nd page).

Note: there are 3 pair of nodes which might look confusing. For some reasons nodes were not be able to stay in different location to avoid this awkward intersection(overlapiong) of edges.
